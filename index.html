  <h1>Neuro<span>Check</span> Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</div>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>The short version:</strong> NeuroCheck does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Everything stays on your device. We don't track you. We don't sell anything. We don't even have a server.
  </div>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>NeuroCheck is developed by NeuroCheck Labs, an independent development studio focused on building tools for neurodivergent professionals and students.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>None. NeuroCheck stores all data locally on your device using your browser's or app's local storage. This includes your neurotype profile selection, career selection, checklist progress, Sparks balance, settings, and any custom checklist items you create.</p>
  <p>We have no servers, no databases, no analytics, and no user accounts. We cannot access your data because it never leaves your device.</p>

  <h2>Advertising</h2>
  <p>NeuroCheck displays ads through Google AdMob to support free access to all features. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data in accordance with Google's privacy policy. You can remove all ads by:</p>
  <p>• Spending earned Sparks (in-app currency) in the Spark Shop</p>
  <p>• Making a one-time $2.99 purchase to remove ads permanently</p>
  <p>When ads are removed, no ad-related data collection occurs.</p>

  <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>NeuroCheck offers an optional one-time purchase ($2.99) to remove ads permanently. This transaction is processed entirely by Google Play. We do not receive, store, or have access to any payment information.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The only third-party service integrated into NeuroCheck is Google AdMob for advertising. No other third-party services, analytics platforms, or tracking tools are used. For information on how AdMob handles data, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>NeuroCheck is designed for students and professionals of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Since all data is stored locally on the device and never transmitted to us, there is no data collection to speak of.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is as secure as your device. Since NeuroCheck stores everything locally and transmits nothing, there is no network-based attack surface. If you uninstall the app or clear its data, all stored information is permanently deleted.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we ever change this privacy policy, we will update this page with the new date. Since we don't have your contact information (because we don't collect it), this page is the only way to communicate changes.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact us at:</p>
